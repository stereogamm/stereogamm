## Hello, World! 💻

### Welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
I'm a budding front-end developer who has traded in my QA hat 🚫 for a coding cape ✅. With a background as Quality Assurance Engineer for both startups and big tech companies, I bring a unique perspective to the world of web development.

When I’m not busy debugging code or wondering why my JS won’t behave, you can find me lost in a good book 📚 or trying to convince my dog 🐕 to scoot over just a little bit on my work chair.

 Feel free to explore my projects, and remember: there are no bugs, just features in disguise!
